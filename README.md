# Semantic Relation-aware Difference Representation Learning for Change Captioning
This package contains the accompanying code for the following paper:

Tu, Yunbin, et al. ["Semantic Relation-aware Difference Representation Learning for Change Captioning."](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.6.pdf), which has appeared as long paper in the Findings of the ACL, 2021. 

## We illustrate the training details as follows:

## usage

### Installation
Clone the repository (git clone git@github.com:Seth-Park/RobustChangeCaptioning.git)
cd RobustChangeCaptioning
Make virtual environment with Python 3.5 (mkvirtualenv rcc -p python3.5)
Install requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Setup COCO caption eval tools (github) (Since the repo only supports Python 2.7, either create a separate virtual environment with Python 2.7 or modify the code to be compatible with Python 3.5).
